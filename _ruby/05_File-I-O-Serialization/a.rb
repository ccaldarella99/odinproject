#1. Load in a file containing the text or document you want to analyze.
#2. As you load the file line by line, keep a count of how many lines there were (one of your statistics taken care of).
#3. Put the text into a string and measure its length to get your character count.
#4. Temporarily remove all whitespace and measure the length of the resulting string to get the character count excluding spaces.
#5. Split out all the whitespace to find out how many words there are.
#6. Split on full stops to find out how many sentences there are.
#7. Split on double newlines to find out how many paragraphs there are.
#8. Perform calculations to work out the averages.
